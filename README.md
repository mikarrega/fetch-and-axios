# About the project
The objective of this project is to verify in practice the difference between consuming an API using Fetch or Axios

# Fetch
Fetch is an API that allows an application to make HTTP requests to retrieve web resources. It is supported by almost all modern browsers.

# Axios
Axios is a javascript library that allows you to easily make HTTP requests. Based on the Fetch API, but it has some additional advantages, such as the ability to cancel requests and handle errors more easily. Compatible with modern browsers and can also be used in Node.js applications.

# Conclusion
The Fetch API can be a little more difficult to use than Axios as it requires more code to handle errors and cancel requests. Axios offers a simpler, more intuitive API with easier-to-use methods for making requests and handling errors. Fetch already comes by default, Axios we need to install as a dependency.
